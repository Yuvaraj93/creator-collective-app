Here’s your **refined Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Besto as a Mobile App** (instead of a PWA). I’ve restructured the draft you shared to fit a proper **mobile-first app PRD format** and cleaned up the overlaps.

# Product Requirements Document – Besto (Mobile App)

## 1. Overview

**App Name:** Besto

**Tagline:** *“Capture ideas instantly, act on them effortlessly.”*

**Description:**
Besto is an intelligent **mobile app** designed to revolutionize how users capture, organize, and act on their thoughts using **voice-powered note-taking**. The app seamlessly transforms spoken words into structured notes, automatically categorizes them into **todos or calendar events**, and syncs across devices. By leveraging **AI-powered speech recognition** and **natural language processing (NLP)**, Besto removes the friction between having an idea and turning it into productivity.

**Target Audience:**

* Busy professionals
* Students
* Entrepreneurs
* Anyone who frequently captures ideas on-the-go but finds traditional note-taking inconvenient

**Problem Statement:**
People lose valuable ideas due to inconvenient note-taking processes. Organizing raw notes into **actionable tasks and scheduled events** is often tedious. Besto solves this by making idea capture **instant, intelligent, and structured**.

✅ This PRD is now **mobile app–specific** (React Native / native SDKs), instead of web-focused PWA.
Would you like me to also create a **feature roadmap (MVP → v2 → premium add-ons)** so you can prioritize what to build first?
